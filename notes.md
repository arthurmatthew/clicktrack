# Personal Notes

### Features & Fixes from testing session 2/5/25

- Gradual Tempo Changes
- Custom Start Position
- Custom Accents (Early versions prob just downbeat)
- Custom Metronome Sound (contributor implemented this, could be square triangle etc, more percussive sounds)

- More robust login requirements
- - no fake emails, password length requirement (6 is the limit but it doesn't say that)
- - similarly, implement firebase login errors rather than being vague
- - more providers - login with google
- - email verification (dont interrupt user flow)
- - forgot password feature
- Display name limit stricter & purposeful
- Metronome sine wave overlaps at higher tempos
- fix light mode (darker bg, lighter elements)
- #### 1/1 not working, bad metronome logic . anything denominator of 1
